Simplify ssh logins \u00b6 To log into a Raspi with ssh raspi instead of ssh pi@raspi.local , add this to your ~/.ssh/config file: 1 2 3 4 5 Host raspi, raspi.local HostName raspi.local User pi StrictHostKeyChecking no UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null Ensure that ~/.ssh/config is visible only to you by setting the permissions with: 1 sudo chmod 400 ~/.ssh/config The StrictHostKeyChecking no option will prevent authenticity prompts from appearing during ssh logins and when doing git pushes with git push raspi master . You will no longer see prompts like this: 1 2 3 The authenticity of host 'raspi.local (fe84::d84b:3c2:9ba9:afa7%en0)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:g+fFiMPfdWH8Lwi6eKjAOWgYoTfDAPh00GnsLLE88fk. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? The UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null option will prevent ssh from writing to .ssh/known_hosts and then later failing when host keys change. In general, this is not a good security practice, but it is acceptable when working with local Raspis since you are on a private LAN and not likely dealing with malicious hosts.
